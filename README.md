# A-Star
Randomly generated mazes which are solved using A Star 

This programme randomly generates a grid with obstacles and then finds the quickest path between the two opposite corners using the A Star algorithm. Within the python file, the likelihood of an obstacle can be varied, as can the dimensions of the grid and the start/end points.
